Flightspy
========
A simple python wrapper for Google's cheap flights API that lets you generate a CSV file with flight data from the command line.

Installation
============
I haven't uploaded this to PyPi yet, but I plan to as soon as it's complete.

Usage
=====
Currently the program just prints the price of the flight to STDOUT, which isn't terribly useful, but I'm working on a script that will output flight data to a CSV.
